This directory contains the implementation of the HostTracker components.

* The HostTracker object contains information that is known or discovered
about a host.  It provides an API to get/set host data in a thread-safe
manner.

* The global host_cache is used to cache HostTracker objects so that they
can be shared between threads.
    - The host_cache holds a shared_ptr to each HostTracker object. This
    allows the HostTracker to be removed from the host cache without 
    invalidating the HostTracker held by other threads.

* The HostTrackerModule is used to read in initial known information about
hosts, populate HostTracker objects, and place them in the host_cache.

* The HostCache object is a thread-safe global LRU cache.  The cache is
shared between all packet threads.  It contains HostTracker objects and
provides a way for packet threads to store and retrieve data about
hosts as it is discovered.  In the long run this cache will replace the
current Hosts table and will be the central, shared repository for data
about hosts.

* The HostCacheModule is used to configure the HostCache's size.
